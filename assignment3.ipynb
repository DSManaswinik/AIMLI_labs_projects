        "To accomplish the exercise of plotting multiple plots together using plt.subplots() and utilizing Seaborn for a different plot type, we can follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Choose Two Plot Types: For this example, let's use a line plot and a bar plot.\n",
        "Use plt.subplots(): This function allows us to create a grid of subplots.\n",
        "Select a New Seaborn Plot Type: We can use a violin plot, which is a great way to visualize the distribution of data\n",
        "Data Generation:\n",
        "\n",
        "We generate a sine wave for the line plot.\n",
        "We create random integer values for the bar plot.\n",
        "Subplots:\n",
        "\n",
        "We create a figure with two subplots arranged vertically.\n",

        "1) Maximum/Minimum Values for Each Body Type\n",
        "To determine which body type is the \"costliest,\" you would typically look at the maximum and minimum prices associated with each body type. Here’s how you might approach this:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Analysis: Calculate the maximum and minimum prices for each body type in your dataset. This can be done using group-by operations in pandas.\n",
        "Costliest Body Type: The body type with the highest maximum price could be considered the costliest. However, it’s also important to consider how many cars of that body type are in the dataset and their price distribution.\n",
        "2) Interquartile Range (IQR) Consideration\n",
        "The interquartile range (IQR) provides insight into the spread of the middle 50% of the data, which can be more informative than just looking at the maximum and minimum values. Here’s why:\n",
        "\n",
        "Outliers: Maximum and minimum values can be influenced by outliers. For example, if a few luxury cars skew the maximum price for a body type, it may not accurately represent the typical price for that body type.\n",
        "Price Distribution: The IQR helps to understand the price distribution within each body type. A body type with a high IQR might indicate a wider range of prices, suggesting variability in features, quality, or demand.\n",
        "Comparison: By comparing the IQRs of different body types, you can gain insights into which body types have more consistent pricing versus those that are more variable.\n",
        "3) Body Style as a Predictor for Price\n",
        "The body style of a car can indeed be a good predictor for its price, but several factors should be considered:\n",
        "\n",
        "Market Demand: Certain body styles (e.g., SUVs, sedans, sports cars) may be more popular in specific markets, affecting their prices.\n",
        "Features and Specifications: Different body styles often come with different features, engine types, and specifications, which can influence pricing.\n",
        "Consumer Preferences: Trends in consumer preferences can shift over time, impacting the desirability and pricing of certain body styles.\n",
        "Statistical Analysis: To assess the predictive power of body style on price, you could perform regression analysis or machine learning modeling. This would allow you to quantify the relationship and see how much of the price variation can be explained by body style, controlling for other factors like age, mileage, brand, etc.\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "In summary, while maximum and minimum values provide a starting point for understanding the costliness of different body types, incorporating the IQR and other statistical measures can lead to a more nuanced interpretation. Additionally, body style can be a significant predictor of price, but it should be analyzed in conjunction with other variables to draw more accurate conclusions.\n",
