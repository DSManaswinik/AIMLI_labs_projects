        "\n",
        "The following are some of the particular challenges of manifold learning, which all contrast poorly with PCA:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) In manifold learning, there is no good framework for handling missing data. In contrast, there are straightforward iterative approaches for missing data in PCA.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) In manifold learning, the presence of noise in the data can \"short-circuit\" the manifold and drastically change the embedding. In contrast, PCA naturally filters noise from the most important components.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) The manifold embedding result is generally highly dependent on the number of neighbors chosen, and there is generally no solid quantitative way to choose an optimal number of neighbors. In contrast, PCA does not involve such a choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) In manifold learning, the globally optimal number of output dimensions is difficult to determine. In contrast, PCA lets you find the output dimension based on the explained variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) In manifold learning, the meaning of the embedded dimensions is not always clear. In PCA, the principal components have a very clear meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) In manifold learning the computational expense of manifold methods scales as O[N^2] or O[N^3]. For PCA, there exist randomized approaches that are generally much faster (though see the megaman package for some more scalable implementations of manifold learning).\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore with all that on the table, the only clear advantage of manifold learning methods over PCA is their ability to preserve nonlinear relationships in the data; for that reason I tend to explore data with manifold methods only after first exploring them with PCA.\n",

        "The algorithm connects almost every point to many others, approximating a fully connected graph. The manifold may lose its local structure, as distances between points can be overly smoothed, reducing sensitivity to non-linear relationships. This can lead to a poor representation of the true low-dimensional manifold. When 𝑘 k is Very Small:\n",
        "\n",
        "Only the closest points are connected, and the graph becomes sparse. If 𝑘 k is too small, the graph may become disconnected, causing the algorithm to fail in preserving global structure.
