        "Application: In image compression, PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of image data while retaining as much information as possible. Images often contain highly correlated pixel values, which PCA can transform into uncorrelated components ranked by importance.\n",

        "Flatten the image into a 2D array (if not already).\n",
        "Apply PCA to retain the top k components, where k is chosen based on the desired amount of retained variance (e.g., 90%).\n",
        "Reconstruct the image using the retained components, significantly reducing the storage size.\n",
        "Advantages: PCA reduces storage requirements and speeds up processing while maintaining visual quality.\n",
        "Example: PCA-based compression is commonly used in face recognition systems where reduced-dimensional data speeds up comparisons.\n"
